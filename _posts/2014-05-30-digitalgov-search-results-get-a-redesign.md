[Bing](http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/17/bing-reveals-its-redesign-and-latest-improvements/), [Google](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3027704/how-googles-redesigned-search-results-augur-a-more-beautiful-web), and [Yahoo](http://mashable.com/2013/06/05/yahoo-redesigns-its-search-page/) have all rolled out major redesigns to their search results pages in the past year.

The last time [DigitalGov Search](https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/search/ "DigitalGov Search") did a major redesign of their results page was in January 2012. It was long overdue for a facelift.

So, our team redesigned our search results page. We&#8217;ve kept an eye on best practices in the search industry and what media websites (like NPR.org and NYTimes.com) are up to, But, we&#8217;re not simply following the leaders. We&#8217;ve also [analyzed our search data](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/07/analyzing-search-data-in-real-time-to-drive-decisions/ "Analyzing Search Data in Real-Time to Drive Decisions") to make data-driven decisions that, ultimately, aim to make searchers&#8217; experience better on agencies&#8217; sites.
