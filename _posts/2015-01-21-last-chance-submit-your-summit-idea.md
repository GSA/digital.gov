You might remember in the post [Crowdsourced Digital Citizen Services Summit](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/12/15/crowdsourced-digital-citizen-services-summit/ "Crowdsourced Digital Citizen Services Summit") we said &#8220;[Go to Citizen Services Summit 2015. Go there now!](https://crowdhall.com/h/299/)&#8221; Well if you haven&#8217;t yet, there is still time to go there and propose a session, idea, or speaker.

Anyone can propose a session.

We’re accepting proposals through the end of January.

And, while you can add your proposed topic anonymously, if you create an account, you’ll be able to edit or add to your suggestion and get feedback from us. We want to know what you want to know!

If you are having problems accessing the submission platform <a href="mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov?subject=Summit+Presentation+Idea" target="_blank">email us your presentation idea</a> and we will post it for you.

Also, the Digital Citizen Services Summit is sold out. You can [sign up for the waiting list](https://www.digitalgov.gov/event/2015-digitalgov-citizen-services-summit/ "Spring 2015 DigitalGov Citizen Services Summit"), **but** if your idea get&#8217;s picked for the agenda we will add you to the guest list.
