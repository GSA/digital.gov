****<span style="font-weight: 400">This year, the deadline for agencies to submit their reporting of incentive prize competitions and challenges for FY16 comes earlier than most. Roughly two weeks from today, by Nov. 18, federal agencies </span><span style="font-weight: 400">are required</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">to submit their accounts of every prize, competition, or challenge that launched, ran or completed in FY16 via </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">email</span>](mailto:prizes@ostp.eop.gov)<span style="font-weight: 400">. </span>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-152712" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2014/04/600-x-165-ChallengeGov-logo.jpg" alt="Full logo for Challenge.gov with the tagline: &quot;Government Challenges, Your Solutions.&quot;" width="600" height="165" />

<span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="http://www.Challenge.gov">Challenge.gov</a> launched a new feature this week to support agencies in their efforts. The Annual Prize Reporting tool equips agency challenge managers with a one-click tool for downloading key data on their challenges. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">How does it work? It’s simple:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Log on to Challenge.gov as an agency administrator.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Click “Annual Prize Reporting” in your tool menu bar.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Select your agency &#8212; “All” will pull a comprehensive report for all challenges run by your parent department or agency, or you can select more specific subcomponent agencies.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Select FY16.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Click “download” to export data into a CSV file and save to your device.</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Exported data will include challenge titles, links and manager POC details as well as key dates, prizes, submissions data, results and other data for incentive prizes hosted on Challenge.gov. These data points can be married with more detailed narratives on each event. (For challenges hosted externally, only information previously entered by your teams on Challenge.gov will be provided.)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Still need a demo? We’ve got one: <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/3423150611212384259">Register online</a> and join us at 2 p.m. ET, Thursday, Nov. 10.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Each year, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) issues a data call to federal agencies, compiling their inputs on the use and benefits of prize competitions and challenges, and how the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act and other prize authorities are building capacity to help agencies achieve their missions more creatively, efficiently and cost-effectively. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Details are published annually in an Implementation of Federal Prize Authority Progress Report presented to Congress for the preceding fiscal year. The </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">FY15 report</span>](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/fy2015_competes_prizes_report.pdf)<span style="font-weight: 400">, released in August, outlined 116 prizes offered by 41 agencies in FY 2015.</span>
