Stephanie Thum from Ex-Im Bank kicks off our video blog with an introduction to customer experience.

Stephanie is Vice President of Customer Experience at Ex-Im Bank, a U.S. government agency which serves as the official export credit agency of the United States. We had a chance to sit down and talk with Stephanie about customer experience and why leadership support at the highest levels is so important to successful customer experience programs.
