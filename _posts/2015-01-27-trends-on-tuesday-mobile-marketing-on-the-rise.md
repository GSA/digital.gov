Marketers are increasingly using SMS, push notifications, mobile apps, location-based functionality and other mobile-first techniques to reach constituents. That’s according to a [recent article from Marketingland.com](http://marketingland.com/salesforce-mobile-now-center-customer-journey-114133), which provided an overview of the mobile trends presented in [Salesforce’s 2015 State of Marketing Report](http://blogs.salesforce.com/company/2015/01/2015-state-of-marketing.html). The report was based on a survey of 5,000 marketers in 10 countries.

Some notable survey results were:

  * More than one-quarter of marketers have a mobile app (27%). An additional 34% were planning to create one in the coming year.
  
    The use of mobile marketing doubled since the last report: 46% of respondents said they were currently using some form of mobile marketing, versus 23% in the 2014 report.
  * Mobile marketing does not stand alone: for respondents who were using mobile marketing, 68% had integrated it into their overall marketing strategy.
  * Mobile loyalty campaigns were rated as the most effective mobile marketing tactic (see graphic below).

A majority of respondents (86%) also said that it is important to &#8220;create a cohesive customer journey.&#8221; Mobile applications were named the most effective technology for creating that cohesion.

Marketers of all stripes are looking towards the mobile future. Although traditional marketing can be viewed as communicating a product’s value in order to sell it, marketing can also be seen as raising awareness through relationship-building.

This sphere of marketing is critical to government. As the public increasingly depends on mobile devices and apps, federal agencies must become &#8220;marketers&#8221; that deliver information and services in mobile-friendly formats. Any agency can make [mobile-first content](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/09/30/mobile-first/), and mobile is one of the [15 government customer service trends we see happening in 2015](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/01/12/15-government-customer-service-trends-for-2015/). Through mobile, agencies will position themselves to meet 21st century needs.
