Since we last featured this app, the USPS has added the ability to schedule pickups and order supplies.

Last month, USPS Mobile version 3.8 was released. The new version allows users to see special hours for various USPS locations and has a &#8220;Coupons&#8221; feature that allows users to scan bar codes on mobile phones.

The U.S. Postal Service Mobile App is available for the iOS, Android and Blackberry platforms and can also be accessed as a mobile friendly website.
