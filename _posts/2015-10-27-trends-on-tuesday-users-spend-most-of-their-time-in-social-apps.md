ComScore released a [<span style="font-weight: 400">new 2015 U.S. Mobile App report</span>](http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2015/The-2015-US-Mobile-App-Report) <span style="font-weight: 400">tracking native mobile app usage among adults over 18 years old, and it reinforced a lot of the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">trends we’ve been reporting on DigitalGov</span>](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/09/01/trends-on-tuesday-mobile-messaging-and-social-app-research-released/)<span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

[<span style="font-weight: 400">Quartz succinctly summarized the report</span>](http://qz.com/508997/you-really-only-use-three-apps-on-your-phone/) <span style="font-weight: 400">with the headline: “You really only use three apps on your phone.” The report clearly pointed out that Americans spend 50% of their time in their most-used app, and 78% in their top three favorite apps.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Other notable data points:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">From June 2013 until June 2015, the time spent on mobile overall jumped 11%; the time spent on mobile apps jumped 12%; and the time spent on desktop devices dropped 11%.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">During the same time period, total digital media usage grew 49%, with app usage growing 90% in the past two years.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">On mobile devices, people spend 87% of their time in apps versus 13% in browsers.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Despite users spending more time in apps, the mobile Web has the largest audience, with 433 million unique visitors vs. 123 million.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Social media and entertainment apps account for the six top app categories and drive two-thirds of total time spent on apps. Even more astounding: The average mobile user spends a whopping 26 hours per month on social apps, and that average is 16% higher among millennials! </span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400">It is crucial for government agencies to consider this data in digital product decision making, especially when analyzing app usage numbers and your potential audience. Are their </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">mobile moments</span>](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/06/01/finding-the-best-mobile-moment-is-the-first-stepping-stone-to-anytime-anywhere-government/) <span style="font-weight: 400">going to be social or entertainment driven ones? If so, then consider an app approach, but otherwise it might be a difficult process to get users to regularly engage with your digital experience. </span>
