The [Government Contact Center Council (G3C)](https://www.digitalgov.gov/communities/government-contact-center-council-g3c/ "Government Contact Center Council (G3C)"), led by GSA’s Tonya Beres, has been working with DigitalGov University to host events for the contact center community across the federal government.

This year they hosted events and posted articles that will help you get a contact center up and running, make up-to-date changes to meet 21st century expectations, and incorporate new features like adaptive content, chat, and handling social media inquiries.

In June the G3C hosted their annual workshop where Mary Ann Monroe, Director of Customer Experience in GSA’s Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies (OCSIT), shared the results and best practices from [J.D. Power and Associates&#8217; audit of the USA.gov Contact Center](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2015/03/061214-G3C-Meeting-Mary-Ann-Monroe-USAgov-Contact-Center-Case-Study-JD-Power-Assessment-and-Customer-Satisfaction-Results.pptx "USA.gov Contact Center Case Study JD Power Assessment and Customer Satisfaction Results") (.pptx, 193 kb). There were also presentations by Ellis Hall of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [on lessons learned from EEOC&#8217;s call centers](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2015/03/061214-G3C-Meeting-Ellis-Hall-Presentation-Introduction-Equal-Employment-Opportunity-Commission.pptx "Introduction Equal Employment Opportunity Commission") (.pptx, 75 kb) and Rosetta Lue of the City of Philadelphia on [Customer Experience Data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2015/03/061214-G3C-Meeting-Rosetta-Lue-Collecting-Customer-Experience-Data.ppt "Collecting Customer Experience Data") (.ppt, 1MB). Martha Dorris, Associate Administrator for GSA’s OCSIT presented on [Customer Service Initiatives Across Government](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2015/03/061214-G3C-Meeting-Martha-Dorris-Customer-Service-Initiatives-Across-Government.pptx "Customer Service Initiatives Across Government") (.pptx, 79 kb).

If you are interested in joining the G3C and attending their monthly events, participation is open to federal, state, and local government employees. They also host a listserv for members to ask questions, share ideas, and provide ongoing support.

Ask Your Contact Center!"), which summarizes how content managers can check in with the contact center. They hear about customers’ experiences—their needs, their satisfaction or dissatisfaction—and then YOU can act on it.
