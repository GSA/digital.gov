Now that Thunderclap has been [approved for government use](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2013/08/05/thunderclap-now-available-for-government-wide-adoption/ "Thunderclap Now Available for Government-Wide Adoption") for nearly a year, we checked in with two agencies that have successfully used the crowd-speaking tool to rally their supporters and amplify their messages. In case you missed it, you can replay the webinar.

## What Makes a Thunderclap?

 **Nicholas Garlow**, public affairs specialist with the **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)** used Thunderclap to [support Open Enrollment Season](https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/9544-getcovered-by-march-31st) for Healthcare.gov. He outlined the necessary components to a campaign:

  * Create a **message** that will be shared, and a story that explains the campaign or event. Including a graphic will make your message more engaging.
  * Set a **date and time** when the message will be sent. Allow at least two weeks for promotion.
  * Set a **supporter goal** of 100, 250, or 500 and ask users to help you share the message via Twitter, Facebook, or Tumblr.
  * Promote the campaign to your social media followers, partners, and email lists.

## Measuring Success

  * If you reach your goal, your message will be shared by your supporters at the same time.
  * Social reach: How many people were exposed to your message?
  * The action point: Did people take the desired action? (Sign up, order, etc.)
  * Did you increase traffic to relevant Web pages?

## When To Use Thunderclap

  * Major observances
  * Events & announcements
  * New product or service launch
  * Issue/topic support

 **Jessica Orquina**, social media lead for the **Environmental Protection Agency** **(EPA)**, has worked on three Thunderclaps, two of which were successful. She shared some lessons learned from their first campaign, [Protect Your Kids!](https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/5938-protect-your-kids), which didn’t reach its goal.

  * Short campaign (less than a week) was not enough time to reach the goal.
  * People didn’t want to give Thunderclap access to their account.

EPA achieved success on their next two campaigns, [On Earth Day, #ActOnClimate!](https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/10319-on-earth-day-actonclimate) and [Be SunWise on Don&#8217;t Fry Day](https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/11750-be-sunwise-on-don-t-fry-day).

## Tips for Success

  * Thunderclap campaign subjects should be of interest to a broad audience, especially millennials.
  * Write a blog post and explain Thunderclap for those not familiar with the tool. Make it clear Thunderclap will only post to their account this one time.
  * Allow enough time for promotion and promote daily on social media. Include current number of supporters in posts. For example: 
      * We need your help! 250 people have supported our Thunderclap, we need 500 to meet our goal!
      * Tag @ThunderclapIT on Twitter.
  * Remember to thank your supporters for promoting the message.
