Sign up now to watch the [DigitalGov Summit](https://www.digitalgov.gov/event/2015-digitalgov-citizen-services-summit/ "Spring 2015 DigitalGov Citizen Services Summit") from the comfort of your desk! We are excited to announce that although we’ve sold out in-person attendance for the DigitalGov Citizen Services Summit, we have just opened up [registration to attend virtually](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2015-spring-citizen-services-summit-registration-12671367401).

Virtual attendance will be an awesome way to experience the event with extras not offered to in-person attendees. Bernetta Reese from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will be our host and MC for virtual attendees. There will also be a dedicated Q & A with presenters, and interviews during the expo. Those of you across the country don’t have to worry about missing out on this stimulating ½ day event.

Another way you can attend the summit is to get [picked to exhibit](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/03/18/showcase-your-innovation-program-at-the-2015-spring-summit/ "Showcase Your Innovation Program at the 2015 Spring Summit"). Like last year, we will be hosting tables for federal agencies to showcase innovations, tools, and resources. Since tables are limited we want to have a good mix of agencies and innovations—and we really hope that you will [apply for a table](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/digitalgov-expo). Remember the table must be:

  * Hosted by a federal agency
  * Showcasing or demoing a government-wide service, community, or tool with a digital theme

Don’t delay—[submit your innovations today](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/digitalgov-expo). The final deadline for submission is May 1st.
