The NPS launched the [Chesapeake Explorer App](http://www.chesapeakeexplorerapp.com/) last October. This app has over 400 different sites to visit. It helps travelers discover places to experience the beauty and history of the Chesapeake Bay region.

  * Search places to go by activity, trail name, or site type
  * Take suggested tours or create your own
  * Share your adventures and keep track of places you have visited
  * Take a picture and send a postcard to friends via mobile!

The Chesapeake Bay area is home to beautiful landscapes, diverse wildlife, and rich history and the Chesapeake Explorer app is a great tool to have on hand and discover places to travel.

This app is available as a free download for both iOS and Android.

You can find other apps like this on the [USA.gov Apps Gallery](http://apps.usa.gov/).
