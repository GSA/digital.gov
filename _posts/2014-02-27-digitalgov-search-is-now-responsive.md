It now uses a card-based design and is responsive. This design gives searchers a more consistent user experience and access to the results anytime, anywhere, and on any device.

Take a sneak peek of the new responsive results page. Go to [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/) (or your website) from any mobile phone or tablet and do a search. See the [sample results page for a search on passports](http://search.usa.gov/search?affiliate=usagov&query=passports&m=true) on USA.gov.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em">You can also <a href="http://search.digitalgov.gov/sites/manual/display-images.html">optimize your mobile search results page by adding or updating your mobile logo</a>. The optimal size is 100&#215;50 pixels (100 pixels wide and 50 pixels high).</span>
