The International Data Corporation (IDC) predicts that &#8220;phablets,&#8221; the popular term for smartphones with screen sizes from 5.5 to less than 7 inches, [will outship portable PCs this year and tablets in 2015](http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25077914). Specifically, total phablet volume will top 318 million units, surpassing the 233 million tablets forecast to ship in 2015. Further, IDC expects phablets to grow from 14.0% of the worldwide smartphone market in 2014 to 32.2% in 2018.

The trend is driven by user preference and device cost, but does not mark the end for smartphones. &#8220;While consumers in places like the United States and Western Europe are likely to own a combination of PCs, tablets, and smartphones, in many places the smartphone—regardless of size—will be the one connected device of choice,&#8221; states IDC.

What&#8217;s an agency to do with the influx of screen sizes? A mobile first strategy will go a long way towards connecting agencies with smartphone and phablet users.
