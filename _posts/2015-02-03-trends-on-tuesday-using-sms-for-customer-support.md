Don&#8217;t forget, mobile first strategy can include text messaging and SMS, not just native apps and responsive Web design. Ninety percent of all SMS messages are read within three minutes of being received, according to a recent blog post on [Gigaom](https://gigaom.com/2015/01/18/why-sms-is-the-new-channel-for-customer-support/). Paired with an average open rate of 98% (versus 22% for email) and the fact that any mobile device out there is able to read a text message, SMS is a great way to reach out to pretty much anyone. Also, unlike most emails, SMS messages are read in their entirety. This represents a great opportunity to provide a new level of customer service.

SMS messages have been used primarily as [marketing tools](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/07/23/trends-on-tuesday-uprise-of-sms-marketing/). But, the time has come for the use of SMS messaging to deliver information that customers need and want on a just in time basis. [Text4Baby](https://www.WHATEVER/2012/08/21/sms-or-short-message-service/), a program designed to provide health information to new mothers, is just one of a number of [SMS campaigns](https://www.WHATEVER/2012/05/12/national-contact-centers-text-message-program/) in the federal government.

SMS messaging is great chance for the government to improve the level of customer service by providing the public with the information they need when they want it. SMS messaging will provide the public with an easy way to communicate directly with the government to better understand the services it provides.
