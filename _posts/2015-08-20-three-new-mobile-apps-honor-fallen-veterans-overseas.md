<span style="font-weight: 400">Information about </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">Flanders Field</span>](https://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials/europe/flanders-field-american-cemetery#.VdS7CCxViko)<span style="font-weight: 400">, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">Meuse-Argonne</span>](https://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials/europe/meuse-argonne-american-cemetery#.VdS61yxViko) <span style="font-weight: 400">and </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">Sicily-Rome</span>](https://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials/europe/sicily-rome-american-cemetery#.VdS7JSxViko) <span style="font-weight: 400">American Cemeteries are all now accessible via mobile apps for both Android and iOS. ABMC developed these apps in line with their strategy of &#8220;</span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">providing an inspirational and educational visitor experience through effective outreach and interpretive programs</span>](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/07/01/planning-with-a-purpose-3-reasons-why-agencies-created-native-apps/)<span style="font-weight: 400">.” Visitors to the cemeteries overseas are able to download these apps prior to travel or via WiFi in the visitor centers.

  <span style="font-weight: 400">Explore the cemetery grounds, and learn about the design and layout</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Take a cemetery tour in as little as one hour, or spend the entire day exploring the site</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">You don’t need to visit the cemeteries in order to benefit from these apps; they offer all users a glimpse of history and the sacrifices our veterans made.</span>
