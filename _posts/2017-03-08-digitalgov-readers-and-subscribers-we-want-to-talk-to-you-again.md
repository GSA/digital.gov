We at DigitalGov want to hear more about you &#8211; your job, your role, the challenges you face — all of it — as you work to deliver more secure, effective, and reliable digital services for the public.

We are going to start holding user-research sessions with our readers who work in the federal government. This will be a big part of how we listen to and learn about those who are providing the public with better services and what their core needs are.

It’s so important to us that we are going to carve out time to get to know you, in person, over the phone, or over video chat and hear your story, first-hand.

If you are interested, [email us](mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov?subject=DigitalGov User Research) and let us know when you are available and how best to reach you. _Interviews usually last an hour._
