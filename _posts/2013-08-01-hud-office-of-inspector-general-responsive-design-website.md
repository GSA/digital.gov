The [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development](http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD) (HUD) has developed a responsive design website for [the HUD Office of Inspector General](http://www.hudoig.gov/).

The website provides: news, the latest reports and publications, locations to field offices, and more. Whether you are using a smart phone, tablet, or other mobile device, the screen automatically adjusts to your device’s screen size making it very user friendly and easy to navigate. The site, developed in Drupal, provides all the essentials needed  to quickly direct the user to where it is they wish to go, without limiting the content. The site features a drop down menu with various options, along with a pop up search bar, and a picture of the leading headline.

The [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development](http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD)’s [Office of Inspector General](http://www.hudoig.gov/) responsive design site gives other government agencies a good example of what can be done with responsive design and allows citizens to easily access information anyplace, anytime.
