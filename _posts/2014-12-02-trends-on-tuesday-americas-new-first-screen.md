It has finally happened: Mobile has bumped TV as America&#8217;s first screen. Recent [analysis from Flurry Analytics](http://www.flurry.com/blog/flurry-insights/mobile-television-we-interrupt-broadcast-again#.VHyqPofinAi), which included [data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/TUS/CHARTS/LEISURE.HTM), found that time spent on mobile devices grew in the U.S. by 9.3% to 2 hrs and 57 minutes, while time spent watching TV has remained flat at 2 hrs and 48 minutes daily.

So what are some of the factors that helped mobile snatch the big prize from television? Flurry says:

  * Overlap between the time spent watching TV and that on mobile devices
  * Smart devices are practical and more consumers use mobile devices for almost every daily task
  * Mobile devices are glued to consumers 24/7/365
  * Time spent in “torso and tail” apps, which are apps below the top 25, grew 21%

This a big moment for the mobile industry, as well as app developers (like us). Despite the belief that the larger players in the app industry would monopolize time spent on mobile, consumers have shown that there is growing interest in specialized applications.
