Some live to work. And all of us look forward to pay day.**

If you work for the Department of Defense, the Executive Office of the President, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Health and Human Services or the Broadcasting Board of Governors, chances are that you are one of 6.6 million people paid by the **[Defense Finance and Accounting Service](http://www.dfas.mil/pressroom/aboutdfas.html)** (DFAS).

That&#8217;s A LOT of paychecks.

In 2012, the digital team at DFAS saw a trend. As much as 15% of the traffic to their website was coming from people using smartphones and other devices to do things like [check their pay](http://www.dfas.mil/mypayinfo.html) (current and retiree), [correct their military records](http://www.dfas.mil/correctmilitaryrecords.html) and [get advice on debt and bankruptcy](http://www.dfas.mil/debtandclaims.html). The team, led by website program manager Debra Fioritto, decided to embark on a major redesign to optimize their site for a variety of screen sizes and types.

Fast forward to May 2014 and a **newly launched, mobile-friendly** **[www.dfas.mil](http://www.dfas.mil)**. Boasting a [responsive design](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/03/24/why-go-responsive-heres-what-feds-are-saying/), the site helps four main categories of users:

  * [Manage their MyPay accounts](http://www.dfas.mil/mypayinfo.html) right from the homepage;
  * [Make online debt payments](http://www.dfas.mil/debtandclaims.html);
  * [Submit travel expense claims](http://www.dfas.mil/dfas/civilianemployees/travelpay/wheretosubmit.html); and/or
  * Find DFAS social media channels and [customer service](http://www.dfas.mil/customerservice.html) contact information.

The responsive architecture eliminates the need for manually &#8220;pinching&#8221; or pulling the screen to view all the content. It also benefits DFAS content managers by offering a more streamlined and efficient Web posting process behind the scenes. Not surprisingly, DFAS reports that mobile traffic to dfas.mil has increased to nearly 30% since 2012, and I suspect the redesigned site will attract even more mobile customers.

If time is money, it&#8217;s definitely worth at least a few minutes exploring the new [www.dfas.mil](http://www.dfas.mil).
