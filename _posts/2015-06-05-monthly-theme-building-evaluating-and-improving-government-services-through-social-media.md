While examples of government social media content may initially seem like mere fun—the [YouTube video of President Obama on Between Two Ferns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnW3xkHxIEQ) or the Transportation Security Administration’s “good catch” pics of [lipstick stun guns](https://instagram.com/p/0WUAzwl9xT/?taken-by=tsa) and [batarangs](https://instagram.com/p/zTOqVrF9wl/?taken-by=tsa)—the potential of applied social data to build, evaluate and improve diverse citizen services is only increasing.

As we recently discussed on DigitalGov, [social media tools are for more than one-way marketing and communication](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/04/24/meeting-customer-needs-through-social-media/): they provide a connective, responsive capability to public services. We [explored some of the biggest programs in government social media](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/12/31/big-in-socialgov-in-2014-services-access-and-participation/) last year, from 3D printing and drones to disease tracking and the Internet of Things.

The [SocialGov Community of Practice](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitalgov.gov%2Fcommunities%2Fsocial-media%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEftOg4z77TqX4v3lnFo74pXnH_UA), including almost 1,000 federal managers from more than 160 federal programs, has been a leader in driving the adoption of emerging technologies and strategies that target the improvement of three capabilities: how government agencies interact and collaborate with the public, other agencies, and within their own organizations.

For example, in February, the [Public Participation Playbook](https://participation.usa.gov/) was released, providing agencies with a resource they can use to evaluate and build better programs that give a voice to the people they serve. Cyber-security for digital engagement is of increasing importance, so agencies worked together to develop and launch [Readiness, Recovery, Response: Social Media Cyber-Vandalism Toolkit](https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/readiness-recovery-response-social-media-cyber-vandalism-toolkit/). Accessibility for people with disabilities is also a critical need, so agencies collaborated on [Improving the Accessibility of Social Media in Government](https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/improving-the-accessibility-of-social-media-in-government/).

In June, we’re focusing on the role social media plays in federal agencies. Our theme articles will touch on a variety of topics, including:
