While we’re anticipating the [Section 508 refresh](http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh), many government digital media teams are facing the task of incorporating [WCAG 2.0 standards](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) in their projects despite having limited staff resources and budget constraints.

We can use creative solutions, such as [crowdsourcing](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/12/08/crowdsourcing-month-an-overview/ "Crowdsourcing Month: An Overview"), to overcome those challenges and make our works accessible. Our teams can call on the public to share their time and skills at events or in projects where they&#8217;ll work with others to solve accessibility problems in design, development, content, etc. Whether teams choose to host a hackathon or produce an ongoing project, we can take cues from [Knowbility’s OpenAIR rally](http://www.knowbility.org/v/open-air/) or [Project: Possibility’s software projects](http://projectpossibility.org/projects.php), both of which successfully use crowdsourcing to produce innovative, accessible solutions.

Our community can even take this further by posting a project on [Challenge.gov](http://challenge.gov) to get help with any common accessibility issues that government digital media teams encounter.

Crowdsourcing and challenges can be practical tools for creating ground-breaking, accessible fixes to common problems. The solutions can enable citizens to accomplish everyday tasks and live ordinary lives that they might not be able to do otherwise.
