Part 2 of our interview with Sarah Crane from USA.gov shares how the USA.gov team is tackling content sprawl with the USA.gov API. Missed Part 1 last week? You&#8217;ll want to [watch it](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/12/video-blog-sarah-crane-usa-gov/ "Video Blog: Sarah Crane, USA.gov") before next Tuesday, when we will publish Part 3 where Sarah talks about adaptive content.
