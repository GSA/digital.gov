We wanted to learn a little more about the [Office of Women&#8217;s Health at FDA](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/05/21/inter-agency-federal-social-media-promotes-womens-health-campaign/ "Inter-Agency Federal Social Media Promotes Womenâ€™s Health Campaign"), where Alison Lemon, the [SocialGov Community](https://www.WHATEVER/communities/social-media/ "Social Media") Knowledge Manager, works. So we sat down with Alison and learned about the interesting social media approach her office has taken, some of the thinking behind their strategy and what she sees as the future of social media in government. You can also follow her office&#8217;s work [@FDAWomen](https://twitter.com/FDAWomen).
