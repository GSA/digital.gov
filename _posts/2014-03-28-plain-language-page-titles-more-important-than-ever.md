Google recently [redesigned its search results page](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3027704/how-googles-redesigned-search-results-augur-a-more-beautiful-web) and there are quite a few small, but impactful, changes in this latest redesign. Specifically, it affects how page titles are displayed.

Many experts now recommend even shorter page titles. Below are a couple of articles (plus tools) to see how the change may affect your page titles:

In addition to the suggestions offered in our [previous article on Achieving Good SEO](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2013/05/31/four-steps-to-achieve-good-seo/), here are a few specific tips for page titles:

1. Place page titles in a 

<title>
  tag within the 
  
  <head>
    .<br /> 2. There’s no magic number, but around 55 characters or less is good.<br /> 3. There’s no set syntax, but &#8220;Primary Keyword &#8211; Secondary Keyword | Brand Name&#8221; is good.</p>
