Search is easy, right? You type a term in a search box and the exact page you&#8217;re looking for appears at the top of the list of results. But search is hard and has many shades of grey.

On April 10, 2014, Loren Siebert, our [DigitalGov Search](https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/search/) senior search architect, presented on:

  * Complexities of recall and precision,
  * Popular open source search technologies, and
  * &#8220;Search magic&#8221; like stemming, synonyms, fuzziness, and stopwords.
