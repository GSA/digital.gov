Major mobile milestones in May—try saying that three times! A new mobile usage report from [ComScore](http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/Major-Mobile-Milestones-in-May-Apps-Now-Drive-Half-of-All-Time-Spent-on-Digital) revealed two significant shifts to mobile in May: total time spent on digital media and time spent on apps. Here are a few highlights from the report:

  * Mobile platforms—smartphones and tablets—accounted for 60% of total time spent on digital media, up from 50% a year ago.
  * Mobile apps accounted for more than half (51%) of all time spent on digital media, up from 43% a year ago.
  * Some content categories—radio, photos, maps and instant messenger—have shifted almost exclusively to mobile with at least 90% of activity coming from mobile platforms.
  * Social networking accounts for 20% of total time spent on digital, and generates more than 70% of its activity on mobile.

Every month, it becomes apparent that mobile will continue to transform how our stakeholders engage with digital content.
