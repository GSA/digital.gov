Phablets, the popular term for smartphones with screen sizes from 5.5 to less than 7 inches, increased in popularity this holiday season. According to Flurry, [13% of new device activations in December were phablets](http://www.flurry.com/blog/flurry-insights/apple-and-apps-dominated-christmas-2014#.VKry2WTF_oi), jumping from 4% in 2013.

Back in October, the International Data Corporation (IDC) predicted that [“phablets” would outship tablets in 2015](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/11/04/trends-on-tuesday-phablets-to-top-tablets-in-2015/). Flurry backs up the IDC report finding that the holiday growth in phablet adoption came at the expense of both full-size and small tablets, whose activation percentages dropped to 11%. Flurry suggests the entrance of the iOS phablet probably helped increase these numbers as the iPhone 6 Plus was one of the top 5 devices activated.

The trend to larger screen sizes should be noted by developers as people are [spending more time watching video on mobile devices](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/12/02/trends-on-tuesday-americas-new-first-screen/).

What’s an agency to do with the influx of screen sizes? A [mobile first strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTYZTwWKaNI&feature=youtube_gdata) will go a long way towards connecting agencies with smartphone and phablet users.
