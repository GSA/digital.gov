NASA recently announced the winners of a [smartwatch app interface competition](http://fedscoop.com/nasa-names-winner-in-smartwatch-app-design-contest). A Canadian duo won the design competition, and NASA’s plan is to build the app with 2016 funding to have it [available for astronauts to use](https://www.freelancer.com/contest/NASA-Challenge-Astronaut-Smartwatch-App-Interface-Design-261634.html) when they are aboard the International Space Station.

This is the first government smartwatch app development we’ve talked about on DigitalGov and an example of a great [mobile moment](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/10/07/is-your-agency-winning-its-mobile-moments/) use case. Not only is the smart app interesting ([see the UI images](https://www.freelancer.com/contest/NASA-Challenge-Astronaut-Smartwatch-App-Interface-Design-261634-byentry-6597765.html)!) but also _how_ NASA is approaching its development is worth examining. While agencies are [crowdsourcing via native apps](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/12/22/how-six-agencies-are-crowdsourcing-with-mobile-apps/) and [crowdsourcing their actual mobile development](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/08/13/nist-hosts-reference-data-challenge-to-create-mobile-apps/), none have publicly crowdsourced just the app design.

While development of native apps requires [easily consumable data](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/09/30/the-data-briefing-connecting-the-data-dots-nasas-nyspacetag-app/), crowdsourcing design requires a little less lift for the agency—essentially, they just need a use case and some requirements for the watch. As we move into the [A-B-C’s of the Internet of Things](https://www.digitalgov.gov/tag/internet-of-things/), new approaches to anywhere, anytime development like this are going to be imperative.

_Looking for ideas on how to craft a successful crowdsourcing project? The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Federal Community of Practice on Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science [recently released a Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing Toolkit](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/09/30/how-ostp-crowdsourced-a-crowdsourcing-toolkit/) to help agencies open up innovation in government. The toolkit contains information, resources, and best practices federal agencies can use to harness the power of public participation._
