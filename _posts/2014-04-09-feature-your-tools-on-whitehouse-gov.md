The White House launched a [hub for consumer-facing tools](http://www.whitehouse.gov/tools) across the federal government, and they want to feature your agency&#8217;s tools that can help make people&#8217;s lives easier.

As of now, they are featuring tools from these agencies:

  * Department of Education&#8217;s [College Scorecard](http://collegecost.ed.gov/scorecard/)
  * Department of Energy&#8217;s [Hybrid Car Calculator](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/hybridCompare.jsp) & [Home Energy Yardstick](https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=HOME_ENERGY_YARDSTICK.showGetStarted)
  * Department of Agriculture&#8217;s [Local Farmer&#8217;s Market Map](http://www.usda.gov/maps/maps/kyfcompassmap.htm)
  * Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&#8217;s [Credit Card Agreement](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/credit-cards/knowbeforeyouowe/)
  * Patent and Trademark Office&#8217;s [Patent Litigation Resource Center](http://www.uspto.gov/patents/litigation/index.jsp)

Check out the tools and [let them know about the tools](http://www.whitehouse.gov/tools/feedback) that should be added.
