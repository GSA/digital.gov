In this digital age, we know customers expect their government interactions to be on the same level as their interactions with the private sector. Agencies are always striving to improve the quality of their services to meet their customers’ needs. So too in our office, where we use the feedback, you, our agency customers, provide to help us improve our programs.

For this month’s theme, we are looking at how some of our services can help you better meet the needs of your customers.

A few of the highlights include:

  * How the [CrowdSource Mobile Testing Program](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/08/14/what-is-mobile-device-compatibility-testing/) can help you ensure your application behaves as your customers expect across the variety of devices they use
  * How the templates from the new [Custom Reporting Catalog](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/08/06/need-actionable-analytics-reports-heres-help/) from the Digital Analytics Program can help you improve your data-driven decision making
  * How the [language support from DigitalGov Search](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/08/31/search-creating-a-good-multilingual-search-experience/) will help your non-English speaking site visitors navigate your search results—in 68 languages

Let us know how we can improve our services—like a butler, with an outstretched hand, _we are at your service_.
