U.S. Hispanics are ahead of the digital curve, according to [an analysis](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/232274/hispanics-ahead-of-the-digital-curve.html "an analysis") of strategies of leading brands and forward-thinking marketers by Lisa Gevelber, Vice President of Americas Marketing. As [we&#8217;ve noted before](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/27/trends-on-tuesday-hispanic-millennials-provide-insight-on-mobile-future/), Hispanics not only lead in adoption of new devices, they are also power users of mobile.

The report highlights a few categories supporting Gevelberâ€™s observations:

  * The average Hispanic spends more than eight hours watching online video each month, over 90 minutes longer than the U.S. average.
  * YouTube views of top U.S. Hispanic channels are up 1.25% year over year.
  * In the two years since the launch of the bilingual multi-channel network MiTu, the network has grown an audience of more than 36 million subscribers, one-third the number of subscribers to HBO.
  * Smartphones are becoming the &#8220;first screen,&#8221; with 10 million Hispanics watching mobile video for an average of more than six hours per month.
  * Among smartphone owners, Hispanics are 17% more likely than non-Hispanics to access the Web through their phone than through a computer, and more likely to upgrade or replace their mobile headsets and buy tablets.
  * Hispanics are 1.5% more likely to buy mobile apps and digital media than non-Hispanics.
