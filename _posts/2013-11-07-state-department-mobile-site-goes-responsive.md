The [Department of State](http://www.state.gov/) has updated their mobile website [m.state.gov](http://m.state.gov) with responsive design.  The site auto-detects mobile devices and displays the State mobile site by default.

State&#8217;s mobile site provides the latest foreign policy information from the State Department. Included are recent stories from the Secretaryâ€™s travels, the daily press briefing, country fact sheets, human rights reports, and more.

[Responsive design](https://www.WHATEVER/tag/responsive-web-design/) is becoming a popular means of creating a single site that can display nicely on a range of device sizes.
