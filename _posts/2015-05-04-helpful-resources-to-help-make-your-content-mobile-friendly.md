Smartphones make up 75% of the mobile market—which makes [mobile-friendliness a must](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/03/31/trends-on-tuesday-smartphone-market-growth-makes-mobile-friendly-a-must/) for government agencies. With the recent update to Google’s search algorithm, or what some are calling [Mobilegeddon](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/04/15/mobilegeddon-government-edition/), the case for building a mobile-friendly site becomes even stronger.

For many government organizations, responsive Web design (RWD) has been the answer to their mobile question. While [RWD is by no means a panacea](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/22/responsive-web-design-should-not-be-your-only-mobile-strategy/), it can provide agencies with a way to reach their customers on many devices with one site.

RWD refers to a fluidly constructed Web page layout that scales from handheld device displays to large, high-resolution computer displays using flexible typography, flexible images, fluid grids, and [CSS3 media queries](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/).

Over the past year, we have published several [articles on RWD](https://www.digitalgov.gov/tag/responsive-web-design/) based on collaboration and case studies provided by members from the [MobileGov Community of Practice](https://www.digitalgov.gov/communities/mobile/).

Here are a few resources to help in your agency&#8217;s quest to become responsive/mobile-friendly.

## **Specific Mobile Web Techniques and Tools**

[Open Source Content Management Systems and Responsive Web Design Webinar Recap](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/09/03/mobile-web-templates-how-to-use-open-source-cms-to-implement-responsive-web-design-webinar-recap/)
  
This helpful webinar discusses content management systems like Drupal and how to use them to“grid” your website for RWD.

[Sites.usa.gov](https://sites.usa.gov/)
  
Sites.usa.gov is a shared service to help agencies focus on creating great content rather than on building systems to deliver that content. Sites provides an easy way to create a website that incorporates RWD and meets federal requirements.

[Digital Analytics Program](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/03/04/what-is-the-digital-analytics-program-dap/)
  
The Digital Analytics Program&#8217;s customized Web analytics solution provides federal employees access to a common set of web metrics like pageviews, unique users, mobile vs. desktop visits, average time on page, bounce rate, number of downloads, etc.

[Code Developed by Department of Health and Human Services to](https://github.com/HHS/HHS-Responsive-Design) [Make](https://github.com/HHS/HHS-Responsive-Design) [Tables](https://github.com/HHS/HHS-Responsive-Design) [Mobile-Friendly](https://github.com/HHS/HHS-Responsive-Design)
  
The Department of Health and Human Services [developed and shared Bootstrap code](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/10/30/hhs-conquers-tables-in-a-responsive-design/) to make tables and charts responsive. The Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS) [leveraged this code for their site](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/12/11/defense-finance-accounting-services-use-hhs-code-to-make-mobile-friendly-tables/).

## **Challenges of RWD**

[Responsive Web Design Challenges Webinar Recap](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/10/21/responsive-web-design-challenges-webinar-recap/)
  
Agencies discuss the challenges faced when implementing RWD, including making a case for why your agency should adopt RWD, scheduling/project management concerns, and dealing with specific things such as PDFs and tables on the redesigned site.

## **Responsive Web Design Case Studies**

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-268912" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2015/04/250-x-444-Search-engine-results-indicating-that-an-NPS-park-website-is-mobile-friendly.jpg" alt="Search engine results indicating that an NPS park website is mobile-friendly" width="250" height="444" />From building the case for RWD to working through procurement cycles, we have a number of case studies showing how agencies implemented RWD.

  * DFAS made a case for switching to RWD when [they saw their mobile usage rates increasing at the same time the site’s bounce rate was also increasing](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/10/21/responsive-web-design-challenges-webinar-recap/), signifying that more people were coming from mobile devices and leaving quickly when they had trouble finding the information they were looking for. DFAS then [utilized the responsive template code developed by HHS to make mobile-friendly data tables](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/12/11/defense-finance-accounting-services-use-hhs-code-to-make-mobile-friendly-tables/).

  * GSA’s Child Care Information Portal was [responsively redesigned based on customer feedback requesting a mobile experience](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2012/10/25/gsas-child-care-information-portal/), as well as a desire to simplify their website management by not having to create separate pages for mobile use.

  * AIDS.gov was one of the first agencies to [implement a responsive design when they saw increasing traffic to their mobile site](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2012/07/11/aids-gov-responsive-design/).

  * HHS.gov [moved to a responsive template to ensure that users accessing their site in a mobile environment had the best possible experience](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/10/30/hhs-conquers-tables-in-a-responsive-design/). One challenge faced by moving a site the size of HHS.gov into a responsive template was making tables work in a responsive environment, which HHS addressed.

  * The National Parks Service park websites were [made mobile-friendly to improve the quality of the user experience and enhance the virtual visit experience](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/04/30/mobile-friendly-park-websites-on-nps-gov/).

  * The Department of Education [implemented a responsive web design while facing the challenges of dealing with multiple content management systems and budget limitations](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/02/12/building-brick-by-brick-ed-govs-website-redesign-and-mobile-implementation/).
