The [Social Security Administration](http://www.ssa.gov) recently announced their new optimized mobile website which is compatible with Android, Blackberry, iPhone, and Windows devices. The mobile website offers a user friendly tabular icon driven navigation, which makes it very easy to find information anytime, anywhere.

This mobile website [was developed with intelligent back end business processes](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pressoffice/pr/ssa-mobile-pr.html) that assist users with identifying documents needed for a new/replacement Social Security number (SSN) card.  Mobile users can also access many of Social Security&#8217;s publications in both English and Spanish.

Social Securityâ€™s mobile website educates the public on how to create a new account, which enables users to access online statements and other related services. The new office locator feature provides directions to a Social Security office nearest to you.

You can find more mobile optimized sites like [socialsecurity.gov](www.socialsecurity.gov) on the [USA.gov Apps Gallery](http://apps.usa.gov/).
