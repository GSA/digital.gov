The Peace Corps just released a new <a href="https://github.com/PeaceCorps/Countries-Regions-REST-API" target="_blank">dataset that lists all of the countries and regions Peace Corps volunteers serve</a>. The API is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">RESTful</a> and uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JSON</a> format. You have [read in earlier columns](https://www.digitalgov.gov/tag/wednesday-api-briefing/) about the different data formats for APIs and how to read the data presented by an API.

As a refresher, I’ve created the following quiz based on the excellent documentation for the Peace Corps Countries and Regions API. All the answers can be found at <a href="https://github.com/PeaceCorps/Countries-Regions-REST-API" target="_blank">https://github.com/PeaceCorps/Countries-Regions-REST-API</a>.

## Question 1

How many API elements does the Country API have?

  1. 5
  2. 10
  3. 24
  4. 40

## Question 2

For the API request example—http://www.peacecorps.gov/api/v1/geography/countries/belize—is there any information on medical considerations? (Hint: The example is in the documentation)

  1. Yes
  2. No

### Question 3

Which API element will return a list of volunteer projects?

  1. list
  2. projects
  3. projects_list
  4. volunteer_projects

The Peace Corps encourages developers and designers to use the API to create innovative apps to help others understand and support its mission. One potential app is to help Peace Corps applicants determine which volunteer projects they may want to work on. Another app is a video player for all of the Peace Corps videos in the dataset. Just exploring the JSON code can give a developer many app ideas.
