Previously you could only log in with your username. You can now:

  * Log in with your username or e-mail address
  * Search your short URLs
  * Add notes to short URLs
  * Shorten URLs from your browser with the bookmarklet
  * Download improved CSV exports
  * Use the API to get all short URLs from your account
