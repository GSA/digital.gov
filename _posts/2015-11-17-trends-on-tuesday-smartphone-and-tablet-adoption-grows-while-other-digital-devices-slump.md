<span style="font-weight: 400">Pew released a <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/technology-device-ownership-2015/">recent report tracking trends</a> in digital device ownership</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">and found smartphones and tablets have continued to grow in recent years, while other devices have stalled.</span>

The big headlines from the report are:

<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Cell phones are now in the hands of more than 92% of U.S. adults, although this trend started to flatten over the past 3 years. That elusive final 8% of U.S. adults might take a while to adopt (or die off, as adults over 65 were the smallest percentage of smartphone users at just 30% of that population, while 78% of them have a cell phone of some sort).</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Smartphones are owned by 68% of the population and that percentage continues to grow at a high rate.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Desktop and laptop computer ownership over the past decade has remained pretty flat, with little to no growth. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Tablet computers have grown to 45% adoption, although in the past year that growth has slowed substantially. Tablet ownership is greater among those who have high incomes (51% of people with an income of $50,000 &#8211; $74,999 own tablets, and that rate is 67% for people who earn $75,000+) as well as those who have completed higher education (62%).</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">After surging in the 00â€™s, MP3 player growth has gone flat of the past 6 years.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">While </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/09/01/trends-on-tuesday-mobile-messaging-and-social-app-research-released/">games remain wildly popular</a> on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, the home gaming console market and portable gaming market has remained flat or lost a few percentage points of users. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">E-book readers, after growing since 2009, hit their peak in 2013 and have since declined. </span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Most of these trends can be attributed to smartphones and tablets becoming more powerful, with more varied and high-quality app experiences, which are able to serve many uses without compromising on quality native device experiences. This affects everything from e-books to MP3 players to gaming consoles. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">With the <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/11/04/trends-on-tuesday-phablets-to-top-tablets-in-2015/">growth of phablets too</a>, smartphones are continuing to grow</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">and are likely cannibalizing some of the potential tablet growth. </span>
