Many government websites are informational in nature &#8211; you don&#8217;t sign up for things or buy anything. Instead, you look for something &#8211; a name, a ruling, some contact information. Informational sites &#8211; and scientific sites in particular &#8211; can be a challenge to design. With so much information, how do you make the important content stand out?

The National Science Foundation&#8217;s [NSF.gov](http://nsf.gov/) site conducted a usability test with some help from the DigitalGov User Experience Program. Here are some screenshots showing how the design improved as a result of the test.

**Before**

  * Users assumed that pages with studies from 2006 or before hadn&#8217;t been updated in years and weren&#8217;t relevant

**After**

  * New &#8220;Most Current&#8221; label let users know that, even if a report was many years old, it could still be the most current data available
