Government agencies are working hard  to communicate complex mountains of data clearly and effectively through graphics. The [Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/), known for their great work creating visual images, has done just that. They have created a great data visualization game just in time for March Madness! The game, &#8220;Population Bracketology&#8221; [tests your knowledge](http://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/057/) of state and metropolitan area population estimates.

## **How it works**

Start by choosing your geographic level: metro areas or states. Click on the name in each match-up that you think has the larger population. Green shows a correct answer, red indicates an incorrect answer. When you have opposing names picked for the next round, pick again. See how close you can come to a perfect score of 63. When you are finished, play again or mouse-over the results to view the most current population estimates for each pair.

My question is should they have included Spokane in the game? After all they do have the #1 seed team, Gonzaga!
