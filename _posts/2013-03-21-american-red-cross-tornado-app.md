The app, which is available on the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cube.arc.tfa&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5jdWJlLmFyYy50ZmEiXQ..) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tornado-by-american-red-cross/id602724318?mt=8) platforms, puts everything you need to know to prepare for a tornado – and all that comes with it – in the palm of your hand. The app includes an audible siren that goes off when a tornado warning is issued in your area. In addition, it provides:

>   * Simple step-by-step instructions to help you know what to do even if the cell towers and TVs are down. Prioritized actions for before, during, and after requires no mobile connectivity.
>   * Audible siren that automatically goes off even if app is closed when the [National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) issues a tornado warning](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/), helping to reduce the chance of sleeping through an actual warning.
>   * Push notification sent when a warning expires – especially important if power goes out while you or your family are in your safe room.
>   * Help distant friends and family in tornado alley with ability to receive tornado watch and warning alerts based on their location from NOAA.
>   * Red Cross location-based open shelters map for when you need it most.
>   * Be ready should a tornado hit by learning how to assemble an emergency kit for your family in the event of power outage or evacuation.
