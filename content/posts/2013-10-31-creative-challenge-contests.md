      Challenge and prize competitions are one path that federal agencies take to drive innovation and solve mission-centric problems—whether technical, scientific, or creative. Creative competitions include multimedia, photo, poster, and design competitions.

    <h2>
      Definition
    </h2>
    
    <div>
      Creative competitions and challenges are about (1) seeking professional, high-quality products, (2) aimed at driving mass citizen awareness and engagement around the message in the challenge, or (3) both. Agencies use this approach to get solvers to create videos, take photographs, make posters, or submit a design concept.
    </div>
    
    <div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      A creative video challenge should not be confused with another type of challenge that allows solvers to submit a video of their technical or scientific concepts (please see <a title="Software and Apps Challenges" href="{{< relref "2013-11-06-software-and-apps-challenges.md" >}}">Software and Apps Challenges</a>).

      <a name="tips-for-challenge-managers"></a>Tips for Challenge Managers
    </h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Clearly define the problem</strong>: For creative challenges, use plain language to tell the entrants what you are looking for and any parameters you expect them to follow.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Go pro or amateur</strong>: Decide whether you are in need of a professional-quality solution or if the goal is to have amateur content with a mission to share a message with a large audience. That will help you decide which platform will work best for your goals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Define your mission statement</strong>: A clear mission statement helps direct the participants and the evaluating entity throughout the process. The same applies to the evaluation criteria; these should be outlined at the beginning to focus submissions toward a usable solution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Outline legal and policy guidelines</strong>: Policies should be clearly defined—those to which the creative challenge must comply, as well as those that govern the kinds of submissions allowed, copyright, intellectual property rights, and Terms of Use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Track program metrics</strong>: Have a clear plan of how you will evaluate the challenge. Depending on the mission, the number of submissions, attention on social media, popularity of submissions, etc., are useful measures of challenge success.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plan communication strategy</strong>: Consider how you will communicate with your community and how often. Be prepared to invest staff time in reading and responding to competition entrants, especially in the few days leading up to the competition deadline. Updating the community frequently helps to engage the participants as part of the process. The more engagement you have with people, the better opportunity for solid and increasingly innovative results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Define the evaluation process</strong>: It can vary depending on the overall goals of the challenge. For stronger community engagement, you might consider more peer-centered judging. To lend greater authority to the decision, you might want to have expert judges or internal representatives lead the evaluation process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plan for implementation</strong>: In order for people to participate in current and future efforts, you must invest time to provide feedback and actually <strong>implement</strong> winning ideas.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Know what motivates entrants</strong>: Research shows that prizes or money are not key motivators for entrants. People want to feel like they helped, made a difference, or improved something.
      </li>
    </ul>
