This memorandum is intended to direct executive departments and agencies to take specific actions to implement the principles of transparency, participation, and collaboration set forth in the [President’s Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/memoranda_fy2009/m09-12.pdf). This Directive was informed by recommendations from the Federal Chief Technology Officer, who solicited public comment through the White House Open Government Initiative.

The four tenets of this memo are:

  * Publish Government Information Online
  * Improve the Quality of Government Information
  * Create and Institutionalize a Culture of Open Government
  * Create an Enabling Policy Framework for Open Government
