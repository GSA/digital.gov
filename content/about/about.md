title: About DigitalGov

---

Welcome to DigitalGov, let us tell you a little bit about what we’re working on…

Many of the people overseeing digital services in the government do not have a technical or design background — yet, they are being asked to make decisions on how government technology is bought, built and delivered.

Our mission — to help people in government deliver smart and effective digital services.

Our job is to know the needs and challenges people in the government face, support them wherever they may be blocked, and tell the stories of their paths toward changing how technology is delivered in the government.

What we have found is that agencies need:
- Guidance on implementing digital policies and initiatives
- Open access to methods, practices, policies, and tools
- Focused trainings and events that help teams learn and adopt new concepts
- Easy access to collaborate with others across government who are working on the same problems

There is an innovation movement in government and digital.gov provides centralized resources that help government be more digitally-focused.

### What we are working on
Over the past several years, DigitalGov has become a destination in government to learn about the methods, practices, policies and tools that are needed to create effective digital services. Yet in many ways, our own site has fallen behind the on the technical measures that we set out for others to follow.

Over the next 3 months, we are going to rebuild DigitalGov into a destination that practices the methods that it teaches, and along the way, we are going to tell the story of how we get there, using the very tools that are available in the open, across the government.

And we believe DigitalGov should set the example for how government learns, builds, delivers and measures digital services in the 21st century.
