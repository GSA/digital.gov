Registration gets your app listed on USAgov’s Federal Mobile Apps Directory and included in a government mobile products API.

**How It Works**

<span style="font-weight: 400">The Federal </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Mobile Products API</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">is the authoritative source for federal mobile Web products (apps and mobile Web). When you register data about your public-facing English and/or Spanish mobile websites and native apps, they are automatically included in</span> a [federal government wide mobile products API](https://socialmobileregistry.digitalgov.gov/). <span style="font-weight: 400">which feeds the</span> [USA.gov Federal Mobile Apps Directory](http://www.usa.gov/mobileapps.shtml) and [Directorio Federal de Aplicaciones (Apps) Móviles](http://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa/conectese-gobierno/apps.moviles.shtml) pages.
