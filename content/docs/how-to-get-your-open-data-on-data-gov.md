Data.gov is the central clearinghouse for open data from the United States federal government. It also provides access to many local government and non-federal open data resources. Find out below how federal, federal geospatial, and non-federal data is funneled to Data.gov and how you can get your data federated on Data.gov for greater discoverability and impact.

This guide is primarily for the [Open Data Points of Contact](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/points-of-contact/) (POC) at each agency. If you would like to add data to Data.gov and you are not the POC for your agency, please contact your POC. If your agency has no POC listed, please continue reading and [contact Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/contact) for assistance.

  Overview
</h2>

Data.gov is primarily a federal open government data site. However, state, local, and tribal governments can also publish  metadata describing their open data resources on Data.gov for greater discoverability. Data.gov does not host data directly (with a few exceptions), but rather aggregates metadata about open data resources in one centralized location. Once an open data source meets the necessary format and metadata requirements, the Data.gov team can harvest the metadata directly, synchronizing that source’s metadata on Data.gov as often as every 24 hours.

**Background**

From 2009-2013, agency updates to the Data.gov catalog were not automated. Federal agencies submitted metadata for individual datasets to Data.gov through a central Dataset Management System (DMS). At present, pursuant to the Federal </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">Open Data Policy</span>](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/policy-memo/) <span style="font-weight: 400">discussed in more detail below, all metadata is added to Data.gov through the federated “harvest” model.</p> 

<p>
  <b>Dataset Updates</b>
</p>

<p>
  Additions, updates, and deletions occur through a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Harvest Source</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> rather than within Data.gov directly. Data.gov synchronizes those changes through a daily </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Harvest Job</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</p>

    Step 1. Organize your open data for the Data.gov Pipeline
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    Getting your data source ready for harvesting by the Data.gov catalog depends on your data source type:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400">
      <b>Federal Data with Project Open Data (non-geospatial):</b> The most common source is the Public Data Listing as required by the Federal Open Data Policy.
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400">
      <b>Federal Geospatial Data:</b> Federal maps, images, GIS products, and other location-based data resources.
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400">
      <b>Non-federal Data:</b> Non-federal </span><span style="font-weight: 400">government</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> sources are not covered by the Federal Open Data Policy, but can be included in the Data.gov catalog voluntarily.</li> </ol> 
      
      <p>
        The steps for all three types of data sources are described in detail below.

Non-CFO-Act agencies are not covered by this policy, but the process for including their data on Data.gov is the same. </p> 
        
        <p>
          Project Open Data requires agencies to list and describe all agency data in the Public Data Listing. If a dataset is not public or restricted access, the metadata for that dataset is still included in the Public Data Listing, but any portion of the metadata that cannot be made public is redacted. The full, unredacted version of the metadata is provided in the Enterprise Data Inventory which is submitted to OMB and not made public.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Agencies must provide a human readable Public Data Listing at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">agency.gov/</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">data and a machine readable listing, as a standalone JSON file on the agency’s website at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">agency.gov</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">/data.json. This data.json file is what gets harvested to the Data.gov catalog.</p> 
          
          <p>
            Federal agencies that do not have a platform to inventory their metadata can make use of a free service hosted by Data.gov called inventory.data.gov (see the </span><a href="{{< relref "inventory-data-gov-guide.md" >}}"><span style="font-weight: 400">separate guide)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.

                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    The Data.gov catalog supports version 1.1 as of December 2, 2014.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    When an agency is ready for Data.gov to harvest their data.json for the first time, they should notify Data.gov via <a href="mailto:datagovhelp@gsa.gov">email</a> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> the Data.gov team will create a new Data.gov harvest source for their data.json. The Data.gov team is available to assist agencies in generating the Public Data Listing data.json file and provide tools that may help agencies prepare their data listings.</p> 
                    
                    <p>
                      <b>Federal data only</b><br /> There should be one single harvest source per agency. If a federal agency aggregates data from non-federal sources, they must ensure the agency’s data.json includes data produced by the agency only. Data.gov harvests all metadata directly from publishers including many non-federal sources and </span><span style="font-weight: 400">works to</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> prevent dataset duplication through intermediaries. It is also important to remember that OMB assesses an agency’s data.json file under the assumption it is comprised of data exclusively from that agency.</p> 
                      
                      <p>
                        <b>Transitioning to data.json</b><br /> When an agency transitions to data.json harvesting for the first time, any existing data on the Data.gov catalog is archived. Data.gov will also provide an export of the existing metadata on Data.gov and note whether any of these datasets were associated with a Data.gov Topic.
                      </p>
                      
                      <p>
                        <b>Replacing datasets</b><br /> When replacing any dataset in your data.json file it is important to maintain same title and identifier associated with the dataset to ensure consistent discoverability of that dataset going forward. When replacing datasets in your data.json harvest source, using the same identifier will ensure that the URL for the dataset on Data.gov stays the same keeping cited links working and reinforcing the open data principle of </span><a href="https://opengovdata.io/2014/permanence-trust-provenance/"><span style="font-weight: 400">permanence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. It should be noted, however, that when replacing datasets on Data.gov with a brand new harvest source (see </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Transitioning to data.json</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> above) that using the same identifier or title may not retain the same URL.</p> 
                        
                        <p>
                          <b>Recovering deleted datasets</b><br /> After a dataset has been deleted from Data.gov (i.e., the agency posted an updated data.json file that does not include a particular dataset), there is a grace period of up to 24 hours where it can be easily restored by working with the Data.gov team.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                          <b>Error log reports</b><br /> Every time the data.json is harvested, an error log is generated that identifies any issues that occurred during the harvest process. If requested, an agency point of contact can receive a daily harvest report with this error log via email.
                        </p>

                          Several federal agencies maintain and manage geospatial data and geographic information systems (GIS). The documentation of  geospatial data is subject to authorities pre-dating the Open Data Policy. are required to develop metadata as outlined in </span><a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/pdf/12906.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">Executive Order 12906</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/circulars_a016_rev/"><span style="font-weight: 400">OMB Circular A-16, revised (2002)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to support the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI). The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) is the interagency group responsible for facilitating these federal activities and collaboration with non-federal organizations on geospatial data efforts. The FGDC has endorsed several geospatial metadata standards, as directed by </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/circulars_a119/"><span style="font-weight: 400">OMB Circular A-119</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,including the Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (</span><a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/csdgm"><span style="font-weight: 400">CSDGM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">), </span><a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/geospatial-metadata-standards"><span style="font-weight: 400">ISO 19115:2003 Geographic Information – Metadata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and several related ISO geospatial standards. Since ISO 19115 and the associated standards are voluntary consensus standards (vs. federally-authored) and endorsed by the FGDC, federal agencies are encouraged to transition to ISO metadata as their agencies are able to do so. While the selection of appropriate standards is dependent on the nature of your metadata collection and publication process, ISO metadata should be considered an option now.

                          <p>
                            In the past, geospatial metadata records were maintained and discoverable via separate catalogs and tools, including Geospatial One Stop. In 2013, these sources were merged so that Data.gov (specifically catalog.data.gov) indexes both geospatial and non-geospatial metadata in one place.
                          </p>
                          
                          <p>
                            Metadata for geospatial datasets in </span><a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset"><span style="font-weight: 400">catalog.data.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is also made available in </span><a href="http://www.geoplatform.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400">GeoPlatform.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. GeoPlatform.gov provides access and management of geospatial resources through common geospatial data, services, and applications contributed and administered by trusted sources and hosted on shared infrastructure for use by federal agencies, agency partners, and the public. Geospatial metadata is made available to GeoPlatform.gov from the metadata harvested by catalog.data.gov and is displayed on GeoPlatform.gov via an application programming interface (API) on catalog.data.gov. In other words, the datasets discoverable on GeoPlatform.gov are from the geospatial metadata collected by the catalog using the following API call: </p> 
                            
                            <p>

                            <p>
                              The majority of open government datasets have some relationship to spatial data (e.g. jurisdiction, address). For the purposes of this document and learning how data gets published in  Data.gov, “geospatial data” here specifically refers to spatial data that has historically been included as part of the Federal Geographic Data Committee and GeoPlatform.gov and utilizes robust geospatial metadata standards such as the the suite of ISO standards or the FGDC’s Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (</span><a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/csdgm"><span style="font-weight: 400">CSDGM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">).These geospatial metadata standards are needed to properly display data and utilize the spatial functionality on GeoPlatform.gov.</p> 
                              
                              <p>
                                <b>Getting geospatial metadata into Data.gov</b>
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>
                                Federal agencies that manage geospatial data should make their geospatial metadata holdings available to Data.gov using a consolidated geospatial harvest source, preferably one single CSW endpoint for the entire agency. For example, all offices and bureaus within the Department of Interior would make their metadata available through one consolidated CSW covering all of the Department of the Interior. (Non-geospatial metadata should be provided separately. See section 3 below.)
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>
                                While a CSW endpoint and traditional geospatial metadata standards are needed for GeoPlatform.gov and Data.gov to consume the data, the Project Open Data (M-13-13) policy still requires  metadata for the agency’s geospatial datasets to be provided within the Enterprise Data Inventory data.json file submitted to OMB with the Project Open Data metadata.
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>
                                In order to facilitate these requirements, the FGDC and Data.gov have developed a <a href="https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/metadata-resources/#crosswalks-for-geospatial-metadata">mapping of elements</a> between the Project Open Data metadata schema v1.1 and the geospatial metadata standards including FGDC CSDGM, ISO 19115:2003, and ISO 19115-1:2014. This crosswalk enables federal agencies with geospatial data to more efficiently meet both metadata requirements.
                              </p>

                                              Data.gov incorporates data sources from state, local, and tribal governments. Non-federal sources are not covered by the Federal Open Data Policy, but can be included in the Data.gov catalog voluntarily. Depending on your local government open data platform, you may already have a harvest source that is Data.gov-ready, or it could take a little more work. Either way, the Data.gov team is available to answer questions about these requirements. For non-federal data to be connected to Data.gov, the following items are required:

The common metadata format across Data.gov is a data model specific to CKAN, but all metadata is also available as DCAT RDF and Schema.org microdata. Data.gov is looking into providing other common metadata schemas across the site including the current Project Open Data schema which is a profile of DCAT using JSON-LD.

However, as part of the OMB policy, all metadata will need to be provided as JSON including metadata that is currently provided as CSDGM/ISO. Data.gov does help maintain the CKAN extension for generating Project Open Data JSON (ckanext-datajson) and this can be used to provide automated conversion from CSDGM/ISO metadata. We are working to coordinate with geospatial agencies interested in using this extension.
