Short URLs have become an essential part of social media communications. They make it easy to share long links with your audience and let you track clicks on your links. Unfortunately, short URLs can create a poor user experience. A short URL could take a user to a trustworthy site or a spam site, but a user would have no way of knowing before he or she clicks. That&#8217;s why USA.gov has made it easy for people to create short, trustworthy .gov URLs that only point to official U.S. government information.
