  Through our Open Opportunities in DigitalGov network, we&#8217;re building a cooperative enterprise that draws on resources from across government to leverage the expertise of forward-leaning agencies.

      Doing “more with less” is expected. But how do you meet stakeholder expectations, deliver on a 21st century government and keep your best and brightest staff engaged? Agencies are coming together to work on different pieces of the digital puzzle.
