Whether for access to emergency, financial or education public services, users need to trust they are engaging with official U.S. government digital accounts.

The [U.S. Digital Registry](https://usdigitalregistry.WHATEVER/) serves as the authoritative resource for agencies, citizens and developers to confirm the official status of social media and public-facing collaboration accounts, mobile apps and mobile websites, and help prevent exploitation from unofficial sources, phishing scams or malicious entities.
