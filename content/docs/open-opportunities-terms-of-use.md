We don’t like lengthy and complicated Terms of Use, so here’s our attempt to make this simple and easy for you.

Here’s what we expect from you:

  * You are a federal employee (sorry, our program limits us to feds only).
  * You’ve cleared your participation with your managers, and your agency expects no reimbursement or formal agreement.
  * You’ll complete your task as agreed from the outset to the best of your ability and make adjustments if you get feedback.
  * You’ll use the comment section on the task for posting your questions about that task.
  * You’ll maintain and uphold the good name and reputation of the program and your agency.
  * You will support the initiative and spread the word using your networks.

Here’s what you can expect from us:

  * We’ll recognize and value your efforts, providing you with the best experience possible.
  * We’ll provide a wide range (different types and time commitments) of regularly updated opportunities–most that can be completed from anywhere.
  * We’ll make sure that the opportunities give an accurate estimate of effort because we respect your time.
  * We won’t ask for ongoing commitments or quotas, just work on the task(s) you want.
  * We’ll give you feedback on your work, but we reserve the right to ask for a rework or to repost the task.
  * We respect the confidentiality of any communications you have with us.
  * We value your feedback because otherwise we can’t make the program better.

## Standards of Conduct

We will review comments and questions that you post and use the following guidelines to review any content you provide.

Any material submitted may be removed if it includes any of the following:

  * Threatening, slanderous or obscene language;
  * Personal attacks;
  * Discriminatory language (including hate speech) based on race, national origin, age, gender, sexual orientation, religion or disability;
  * Sexually explicit material or other material that would violate the law if published here;
  * Ideas or comments that promote services or products, unless submitted in the context of a submission to a relevant opportunity;
  * Repetitive posts (for example, if you submit the same submission or comment multiple times on a single opportunity);
  * Spam or undecipherable language (gratuitous links will be viewed as spam);
  * Proprietary information that you do not hold the right to make public;
  * Entries submitted to which the submitter cannot plausibly hold the copyright or other intellectual property rights; and
  * Personally Identifiable Information (e.g., social security numbers, postal and email addresses, phone numbers).
