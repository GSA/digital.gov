  Introduction
</h2>

[Inventory.data.gov</span>](http://inventory.data.gov/) <span style="font-weight: 400">is a data management tool established in 2013 by the Data.gov Program Management Office (PMO) in </span><span style="font-weight: 400">what is now the Technology Transformation Service</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). Inventory.data.gov supports the implementation of the 2013 Federal </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">Open Data Policy</span>](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf) <span style="font-weight: 400">(M-13-13) by providing all of the relevant metadata fields and export formats required for agencies to have their data harvested by Data.gov and to comply with the Federal Open Data Policy. Inventory.data.gov is not </span><span style="font-weight: 400">required</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">to be used by all agencies, but rather offered in order to assist agencies that do not have another solution for creating and maintaining data inventories.</p> 

<p>
  The platform is primarily used to generate two different data.json files for each agency, one representing the Unredacted Inventory / Enterprise Data Inventory (EDI) that contains unredacted datasets and another representing the Redacted Inventory / Public Data Listing (PDL) that contains datasets with redactions as agency indicated. The Unredacted Inventory/EDI file is a comprehensive inventory for an agency. This file is sent directly to omb.max.gov and not publicly accessed. The Redacted Inventory/PDL file (often referred to as data.json) is made public and is posted on agency.gov/data.json and harvested by the Data.gov catalog.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/">The Data.gov catalog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is based on </span><a href="http://ckan.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">CKAN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network), an open source technology that powers many government open data sites. </span><a href="http://inventory.data.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Inventory.data.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a separate instance of CKAN hosted at GSA on the same infrastructure as the Data.gov catalog. To avoid confusion, neither site should simply be referred to as the “CKAN site”, but instead by the full URL.</p> 
  
  <p>
    This guide describes the features available through inventory.data.gov and provides instructions for agencies interested in using inventory.data.gov for dataset management. At the current level of usage, Data.gov/GSA has been able to provide inventory.data.gov to interested agencies at no cost. This could change in the future </span><span style="font-weight: 400">with expanded usage and services</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</p> 
    
    <p>
      Inventory.data.gov as a dataset management system requires a user account and is not publicly accessible (with the exception of a few datasets that are hosted on inventory.data.gov, discussed in more detail below). Inventory.data.gov allows the registered users to manage the datasets for their agency only.
    </p>

      Features
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Inventory.data.gov provides the following features for dataset management/Open Data Policy compliance purposes:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li style="font-weight: 400">
        Existing data.json and enterprise data inventory metadata can be imported directly into inventory.data.gov.
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400">
        User group organizations can be created either for an entire agency or for individual bureaus so that users and permissions can be managed and delegated as needed by the agency
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400">
        A platform to manage public/non-public datasets: create new entries, modify existing ones, and delete any datasets as needed
      </li>
      <li style="font-weight: 400">
        Unredacted Inventory / Enterprise Data Inventory (EDI) and Redacted Inventory / Public Data Listing (PDL) functionality exports the successfully validated datasets in the form of a data.json file complying to the POD Schema 1.1 version. Error records are provided in a log file for review and resolution by agency users.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Using inventory.data.gov
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Once an agency has consulted with the Data.gov PMO and has decided to use inventory.data.gov for dataset management, the next steps are:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Setting up an “organization” on inventory.data.govFirst, the agency should decide how they want to present their structure within inventory.data.gov. An agency could make the “organization” the entire agency (for example, make the entire Department of Veterans Affairs one “organization). In that case, everyone with a user account associated to VA on inventory.data.gov would be able to view, add, edit or delete datasets for all of VA within inventory.data.gov. An agency could create an “organization” for sub-agencies, for instance creating an organization for the Farm Service Agency and all the other units of the Department of Agriculture. In that scenario, a user account for Farm Service Agency could view, add, edit or delete datasets for the Farm Service Agency only</span>.<span style="font-weight: 400">The Data.gov PMO will set up organizations in the manner requested by the agency.</li> </ol> 
        
        <ol start="2">
          <li>
            Migrating existing datasets to inventory.data.govMost agencies have already created data inventories pursuant to the Open Data Policy. To begin using inventory.data.gov to manage the datasets, the Data.gov team will migrate the existing data listings to inventory.data.gov so that agencies can start editing from the current versions. For agencies that do not have data inventories under the Open Data Policy, but do have datasets listed in the current Data.gov catalog from the old Dataset Management System, the Data.gov PMO can migrate these old listings into inventory.data.gov for the agencies to update.
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <ol start="3">
          <li>
            Creating user accounts for the agency representatives who will be using inventory.data.gov to manage the agency datasets</span>.<span style="font-weight: 400">Inventory.data.gov, for dataset management purposes, is not publicly accessible. Users must have accounts on the system. There are three levels of accounts for any “organization” on inventory.data.gov: Administrator, Editor, and Member. For dataset management, agency users will either have an Administrator or Editor account. Agencies should appoint at least one Administrator. Administrators can add additional members from that agency (organization), including additional Administrators</span>.<span style="font-weight: 400">Agencies should nominate the Administrator(s). The Data.gov PMO will create these accounts and ensure that the Administrators are familiar with the process of adding additional Administrators and Members for their agency (organization).</li> </ol>

                                                Once you have finished entering and editing the metadata for your organization, you are ready to export the datasets to generate the data.json files which comply with  Project Open Data Schema 1.1 version. This is done from the main Organization page, by clicking on  your agency Organization icon on the left or by clicking on your agency Organization name on the top of the page.

                                                The Redacted Inventory button (formerly labeled Public Data Listing) will give you the redacted inventory of all of the datasets from your organization. This is the listing that you will post on your agency.gov/data.json and will be harvested by the Data.gov catalog to populate your organization’s listing in Data.gov catalog.

                                                The Unredacted Inventory (formerly labeled Enterprise Data Inventory) button will give you a file of all of your organization’s datasets without any redactions. This is the file that is submitted to OMB and is not publicly shared unless an agency has made the decision to share it.

                                                    It is very important to make sure that all datasets were successfully exported when downloading the Unredacted (EDI) or Redacted (PDL) data.json file. This can be done by checking to make sure that an errorlog.txt file was not included in the zip file. If there are errors in the errorlog.txt file, those need to be reviewed and resolved before posting the Redacted (PDL) data.json file in the agency.gov/data.json location. This is critical. Ignoring this step can potentially remove datasets from data.gov since they will no longer be present in the data.json file.<br /> Metadata that is directly entered into inventory.data.gov will be validated when the information is first entered, however some invalid metadata may have been imported directly into inventory.data.gov and will not be checked until this final export. The data.gov team is aware that this is not very user friendly or streamlined way of indicating which datasets need to be fixed and is in the process of improving inventory.data.gov so that these errors can be viewed directly on the inventory.data.gov website rather than as a separate log file. However, for now it is very important to review this file as explained earlier.

If there were no errors encountered in creating the data.json, then errorlog.txt file will not appear in the zip file.

If there are any errors, you should review and correct them. When you reach a point where there is no errorlog.txt file, you can upload the data.json file to the agency.gov/data.json public data listing for data.gov catalog harvesting purposes. It is recommended that you manually review and upload the data.json file a few times, before completely automating the entire process to ensure there are no errors that might be excluding datasets from the data.json file (potentially removing existing datasets from data.gov).

                                                        For the time being, the Data.gov PMO will continue to provide this hosting capability on </span><a href="http://inventory.data.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400">inventory.data.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> while it remains small scale and does not require significant additional Data.gov resources.</p>

                                                              If your agency already has an admin listed, do you need their approval to be appointed as an admin?

It seems like many datasets are using the datastore feature on inventory.data.gov – is this no longer the policy and inventory is mainly for creating data.json files?

This webinar focused on the primary purpose of inventory.data.gov – to provide a dataset management system to help agencies create and maintain their data inventories and arrive at a data.json. We do use inventory.data.gov for a second purpose – to host a small number of datasets for agencies that needed a hosting capability at the conclusion of the Socrata platform contract that Data.gov had until July 2014.

If we have standards-compliant (ISO, FGDC, etc.) metadata already published, can we import these metadata fields? Or must we enter them manually?

If there are errors, the zip file will also contain an error log containing information about the datasets with errors. We are working on improving validation within inventory.data.gov so that more errors are identified as you are adding and editing datasets, before you reach the export stage.
