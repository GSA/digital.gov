title: M-11-24 Implementing Executive Order 13571 on Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service

---

[Memo M-11-24](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2011/m11-24.pdf) is guidance to Implement Executive Order 13571. In order to &#8220;keep pace with the public&#8217;s expectations and to respond to budget pressures that demand we do more with less, the Federal Government must deliver services better, faster, and at lower cost.&#8221; This memo helps to guide agencies in doing that.
