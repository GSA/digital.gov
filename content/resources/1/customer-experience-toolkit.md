title: Customer Experience Toolkit

---

Customer Experience (CX) is defined as the sum of all experiences a customer has with your organization. Since government is often a sole-source service provider (e.g., there’s only one place to pay taxes, or get a driver’s license), CX is even more important in the public sector than in other organizations. If that’s not enough to convince you, view this [webinar on why federal agencies must improve CX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFJg-8KwR9I).

This Toolkit is intended to help government agencies improve how we deliver services and information to the public.

How to use this guide:

  - Honestly assess where you’re doing well, and where you need some work, then use the resources below to help you improve
  - Coordinate internally, to ensure your agency “speaks with one voice” across the entire organization
  - Start small and iterate—focus on changes that will have a positive impact on the largest customer groups first

Topics covered in this toolkit include: [Strategy](#Strategy "Strategy"), [Governance](#Governance "Governance"), [Culture](#Culture "Culture"), [Customer Understanding](#Customer-Understanding "Customer Understanding"), [Design](#Design "Design"), [Measurement](#Measurement "Measurement"), [Digital Services](#Digital-Services "Digital Services"), and [Collaboration](#Collaboration "Collaboration").
