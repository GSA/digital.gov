Design and deliver digital services with customer service first in mind and reflect the technologies used by today’s customers. Agencies must respond to customers’ needs and make it easy to find and share information and accomplish important tasks _" anytime, anywhere, any device." _

**June 2011—****[OMB Memo M-11-24 — Implementing Executive Order 13571 on Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2011/m11-24.pdf)**

Requirements include:

  - Establishing one major initiative (signature initiative) that will use technology to improve the customer experience;
  - Establishing mechanisms to solicit customer feedback on Government services and using such feedback regularly to make service improvements;

Enhanced requirements of GPRA requiring agencies to develop annual performance plans that must describe how performance goals are to be achieved, including establishing performance indicators to measure, as appropriate, customer service, efficiency, output, and outcome indicators. Measures should be quantifiable and measurable to define the level of performance to be achieved for program activities each year. Requires each agency performance plan should “establish a balanced set of performance indicators to be used in measuring or assessing progress toward each performance goal, including, as appropriate, customer service, efficiency, output and outcome indicators.

Established a Performance Improvement Council to consider performance improvement experiences of customers (e.g., corporations, nonprofit organizations, foreign, state and local governments) of government services.

**April 7, 2010—**[**Social Media, Web-Based Interactive Technologies, and the Paperwork Reduction Act**](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/inforeg/SocialMediaGuidance_04072010.pdf)

Called for agencies to engage customers in conversations about how to improve Government services.

**March 22, 1995—**[**Presidential Memo on Improving Customer Service**](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/WCPD-1995-03-27/pdf/WCPD-1995-03-27-Pg456.pdf)

Extends Executive Order 12862, which requires agencies to establish and implement customer service standards; survey customers and employees; benchmark; and publish customer service standards. For the first time, the Federal Government’s customers have been told what they have a right to expect when they ask for service.

Further stated that the government is customer-driven and customer-focused, and clarified expectations regarding agency actions, standards, and measurements, including measuring  customer satisfaction as a standard benchmark. Recognized that " without satisfied employees, we cannot have satisfied customers."

Agencies shall “on an ongoing basis measure results achieved against the customer service standards and should also include customer satisfaction as a measure.

  - Measure results achieved against the customer service standards and report those results to customers at least annually;
  - Integrate development and tracking of customer service measures, standards, and performance with other performance initiatives
  - Survey employees on ideas to improve customer service, motivate and recognize employees for meeting or exceeding customer service standards.
  - Initiate and support actions that cut across agency lines to serve shared customers

Customer service standards should relate to legislative activities, including strategic planning and performance measurement under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, reporting on financial and program performance under the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, and the Government Management and Reform Act of 1994.

**September 11, 1993—****[Executive Order 12862 — Setting Customer Service Standards](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/pdf/12862.pdf)**

Requires agencies to establish and implement customer service standards; survey customers and employees; benchmark customer service performance against the best in business (e.g., highest quality of service delivered to customers by private sector organizations providing a comparable or analogous service); publish customer service standards and plans; and publicly report on customer service surveys.

Agencies shall take the following actions:

  - identify the customers who are, or should be, served by the agency;
  - survey customers to determine the kind and quality of services they want and their level of satisfaction with existing services;
  - post service standards and measure results against them;
  - benchmark customer service performance against the best in business;
  - survey front-line employees on barriers to, and ideas for, matching the best in business;
  - provide customers with choices in both the sources of service and the means of delivery;
  - make information, services, and complaint systems easily accessible; and
  - provide means to address customer complaints.

Set performance goals, measure results, publicly report progress. New focus on results, service quality and customer satisfaction. The purposes of this Act are to:
