### About the Council

The G3C is an interagency group of contact center directors and managers from across the government, self-directed, with Co-Chairs from GSA (Tonya Beres) and DHS (Tim Cossairt). We identify best practices, research, and trends that improve government contact centers. The Council’s membership includes more than 215 members from 55 federal, state, and local government agencies and sub-agencies.

GSA’s Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies sponsors the Government Contact Center Council.
