title: 'Challenges &#038; Prizes Community'
---


Thinking about running a challenge and prize competition at your agency, but really want to talk to someone who has done it? Better yet, want to talk to somebody at your own agency, or someone who has run the same type of challenge you want to run?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, the Challenges and Prizes Community of Practice is for you!

Members of the Challenges and Prizes COP gather about four times a year to share ideas, review best practices, and discuss policies and procedures. Membership and participation is open to federal, state, and local government. We host a listserv for members to ask questions, announce new challenges and prizes, voting opportunities, challenge results and impact, events, research, resources, and more.

### Who We Are

The Challenges and Prizes Community of Practice is an inter-agency group of more than 700 U.S. government professionals encouraging innovation in government by promoting challenges, prizes, contests, and competitions through public crowdsourcing.
