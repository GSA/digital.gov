### Who Are We?

If you manage a U.S. government website, or write digital content for your agency, this group is for you! The Web Content Managers Forum is a community of government employees who share ideas, challenges, lessons learned, and best practices in managing the content of government websites. Discussion topics cover content strategy, accessibility, customer experience, plain language, and more.

The Forum is open to U.S. government employees and contractors with a government email address. We’ve been working together since late 2000 to improve the content and usability of U.S. government websites. If you’d like to join the Forum, follow the instructions at the bottom of this page.

Forum members regularly collaborate with other specialized [DigitalGov Communities]({{ site.baseurl }}/communities/)—consider joining if any of these interest you:

  * [Challenges and Prizes Community]({{ site.baseurl }}/communities/challenges-prizes-community/)
  * [Customer Experience Community]({{ site.baseurl }}/communities/customer-experience-community/)
  * [Government Contact Center Council]({{ site.baseurl }}/communities/government-contact-center-council-g3c/)
  * [MobileGov Community of Practice]({{ site.baseurl }}/communities/mobile/)
  * [Multilingual Digital Group]({{ site.baseurl }}/communities/government-multilingual-websites-community/)
  * [Social Media Community of Practice]({{ site.baseurl }}/communities/social-media/)
